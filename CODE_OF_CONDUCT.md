# The Creator's Code

Because we are limited beings,
we make choices that are unwise or flawed.

While others may meet us with hostility,
we choose to acknowledge difference:

Thus we forgive. 

This is a place of learning, understanding, teaching and sharing.
This is a place to affirm valour and compassion.
This is a place for collaborative creation.

Be well, Creator. Be well and create.
